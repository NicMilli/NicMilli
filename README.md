### My latest project:
   [Project Atlier!](https://feedback-milligan.herokuapp.com/) - Acollaborative project between 4 engineers to upgrade an existing eCommerce website to React. The team leveraged Agile practices with Trello for ticketing, git workflows, and unit testing. Most interestingly I got to learn more about page performance metrics, tactics to improve them and considerations to be made when planning in order to minimize performance based refactoring. I setup the repo using Webpack to build and minify files and Babel to compile the code. I setup application wide state management using Redux toolkit and API fetching and caching with RTK Query.
